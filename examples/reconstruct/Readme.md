This example was the start of an attempt to reconstruct a 3D model from 2D views. I had hoped that two views (front and side) would already provide a good starting point, but actually it is now clear to me that this is not the case. A top/bottom view would probably help a lot, but I wanted to use this to convert Doom sprites to voxel models and so don't have views from those angles. So I may not continue this example any further.
